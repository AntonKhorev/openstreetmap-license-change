# Introduction

This is example (but working) code for the algorithm for the
transition from CC-BY-SA to ODbL data.

# Test-Driven Development

This code is intended to be read as a test-driven development. It's
very hard to read most code when it implements a complex algorithm,
especially when it is expected to be read by anyone not fluent in the
language of choice (i.e: Ruby).

In order to improve the understandability of the code, this project is
intended to be test-driven, with well-commented tests to define the
functionality.
